The results stored in maximally_entangled were obtained by training the network with maximally entangled quantum states. This preliminary study throws light upon the architecture dilemma. I.e. which architecture suits best the desired task. The main conlusion drawn in this case is that the optimal architecture for 2x2 entanglement detection is [16,8,1]. The results stored in negativitywise refer result after training and testing the network over density matrices sets of different negativities. In this case, every architecture used is [16,8,1].
